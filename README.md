# psd-to-ecommerce-theme

psd-to-ecommerce-theme is a theme built from a PSD file. This was done for practice and is not for any commercial purposes. 
The technologies used are HTML, CSS, SASS (scss), JQuery plugins. 
It uses the Slick Jquery plugin for the slider and the sticky Jquery plugin for the sticky header elements.
Also, this attempt uses BEM architecture, at which I'm pretty new, so it might not be so pretty.
This is not currently responsive, but might be at some point. Also there is almost no user interactivity.
Javascript might be added at a later date.
